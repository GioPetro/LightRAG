# Building a Chatbot with Zep

> Familiarize yourself with Zep and the Zep SDKs, culminating in building a simple chatbot.

<Tip>
  For an introduction to Zep's memory layer, Knowledge Graph, and other key concepts, see the [Concepts Guide](/concepts).
</Tip>

<Note>
  A Jupyter notebook version of this guide is [available here](https://github.com/getzep/zep-python/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb).
</Note>

In this guide, we'll walk through a simple example of how to use Zep Cloud to build a chatbot. We're going to upload a number of datasets to Zep, building a graph of data about a user.

Then we'll use the Zep Python SDK to retrieve and search the data.

Finally, we'll build a simple chatbot that uses Zep to retrieve and search data to respond to a user.

## Set up your environment

1. Sign up for a [Zep Cloud](https://www.getzep.com/) account.

2. Ensure you install required dependencies into your Python environment before running this notebook. See [Installing Zep SDKs](/sdks) for more information. Optionally create your environment in a `virtualenv`.

```bash
pip install zep-cloud openai rich python-dotenv
```

3. Ensure that you have a `.env` file in your working directory that includes your `ZEP_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

<Note>
  Zep API keys are specific to a project. You can create multiple keys for a
  single project. Visit `Project Settings` in the Zep dashboard to manage your
  API keys.
</Note>

<Info>
  We also provide an 

  [Asynchronous Python client](/sdks#initialize-client)

  .

## Create User and add a Session

Users in Zep may have one or more chat sessions. These are threads of messages between the user and an agent.

<Tip>
  Include the user's **full name** and **email address** when creating a user.
  This improves Zep's ability to associate data, such as emails or documents,
  with a user.

## Datasets

We're going to use the [memory](/concepts#using-memoryadd) and [graph](/adding-data-to-the-graph) APIs to upload an assortment of data to Zep. These include past dialog with the agent, CRM support cases, and billing data.

### Wait a minute or two!

<Tip>
  We've batch uploaded a number of datasets that need to be ingested into Zep's
  graph before they can be queried. In ordinary operation, this data would
  stream into Zep and ingestion latency would be negligible.
</Tip>

## Retrieve data from Zep

We'll start with getting a list of facts, which are stored on the edges of the graph. We'll see the temporal data associated with facts as well as the graph nodes the fact is related to.

<Tip>
  This data is also viewable in the Zep Web application.

The high-level [memory API](/concepts#using-memoryget) provides an easy way to retrieve memory relevant to the current conversation by using the last 4 messages and their proximity to the User node.

<Tip>
  The `memory.get` method is a good starting point for retrieving relevant conversation context. It shortcuts passing recent messages to the `graph.search` API and returns a [context string](/concepts#memory-context), raw facts, and historical chat messages, providing everything needed for your agent's prompts.

In the next cells, Emily starts a new chat session with a support agent and complains that she can't log in. Our simple chatbot will, given relevant facts retrieved from Zep's graph, respond accordingly.

Here, the support agent is provided with Emily's billing information and account status, which Zep retrieves as most relevant to Emily's login issue.

Hi Emily! I'm here to help you. It looks like your account is currently suspended due to a payment failure. This might be the reason you're unable to log in. 

The last transaction on your account failed because the card you were using has expired. If you update your payment information, we can help you get your account reactivated. Would you like assistance with that?

  - goats: In a recent support interaction, a user reported a bug with the magic pen tool in a drawing application,
where attempting to draw boats resulted in the tool drawing goats instead. The user, Emily, described the issue,

temporary workaround, the agent suggested manually selecting the boat shape. Emily expressed hope for a quick 
resolution. Additionally, it was noted that another user, identified as "Emily1c2e," has a suspended account due to
a payment failure.
  - people: Emily is frustrated with the AI art generation feature of PaintWiz, specifically mentioning that the 
people in her drawings are depicted with six fingers, which she finds ridiculous.
