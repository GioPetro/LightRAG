<Accordion title="Does Zep Cloud support multiple spoken languages?">
  We have official multilingual support on our roadmap, enabling the creation of graphs in a user’s own language. Currently, graphs are not explicitly created in the user’s language. However, Zep should work well today with any language, provided you're using a multilingual LLM and your own prompts explicitly state that responses to the user should be in their language.
