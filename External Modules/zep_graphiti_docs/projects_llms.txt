# Projects

<Tip>
  API keys are specific to a project. You can create multiple keys for a single project. Visit 

  `Project Settings`

   in the Zep dashboard to manage your API keys.
</Tip>

Projects bundle elements like Users, Sessions, Groups, Knowledge Graphs, and settings, helping you organize data by service, environment (e.g., development or production), or other relevant criteria.

## Creating a Project

When you sign up for Zep, your first project is automatically created. You'll be asked to configure a few project-specific settings (details below).
If you need more projects, you can create them anytime through the <a href="https://app.getzep.com/projects/create" rel="nofollow">Zep Web App</a>.
